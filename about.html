                    <p class="text-start"> Parents play a crucial role in supporting their children’s learning, and levels of parental
                        engagement are consistently associated with better academic outcomes.

                        The more supported a child feels at home, the more effectively he or she will learn at school.
                        Getting involved in your child’s learning, even in a simple way, will help your child develop a
                        positive attitude towards learning.

                        The purpose of this website is to provide fun activities that parents can do with their children
                        to
                        develop their learning. It includes general information, fun activities and useful tips. This
                        website aims to work with parents and guardians by providing a single reference point and to
                        help
                        better understand their role in their children’s educational development.

                        As a parent, how can I help with my child’s learning?
                        All the fun activities that you do with your child at home are important in supporting their
                        learning and development, and have a really long lasting effect on your child’s learning as they
                        progress through school.
                        Even when your child is very young and is not yet able to talk, talking to them helps them to
                        learn
                        and understand new words and ideas. If you make the time every day to use these on-line learning
                        materials with your child it will make a real difference to your child’s confidence as a young
                        learner.
